# AWS IoT Greengrass for the Texas Instruments Jacinto7 TDA4VMXEVM

**DISCLAIMER** This walk-through currently uses the arago
configuration for the `zeus` branch.  This branch will not be used for
the TI Processor SDK.

In this tutorial, you will build the Embedded Linux image using the
Yocto Project delivered as part of the Texas Instruments Processor SDK
for Linux.

You may perform the build steps on an EC2 instance, copy the image
locally, and then flash the MicroSD locally.  The steps in this
tutorial expects you are working on a local workstation.

## Preparation

You will need to complete all preparation steps to complete all the
sections in this tutorial successfully.

### Provisioning script (optional)

For convenience, a Vagrantfile, provisioning script (`bootstrap.sh`) and build script (`starsdkbuild.sh`) are available to create a virtual machine under [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com).

#### Vagrant setup of SDK (optional)

1. Download and install a Virtual Machine technology (such as [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)).

*NB* - the Vagranfile here has been developed and tested with Virtual Box.

2. Download and install [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com).

3. From the `TDA4VMXEVM` directory, start Vagrant with

   ```bash
   vagrant up
   ```

Vagrant will download an Ubuntu 16.04 virtual machine and run the provisioning script `bootstrap.sh` to 

* Download cross-compiling toolchains
* Clone the TI SDK from the git repo
* Setup the SDK for development with meta-aws
* Clone the meta-aws layer into the SDK tree

This will take some time, but once the command is finished, connect to the virtual machine with

   ```bash
   vagrant ssh
   ```

4. The build can be initiated with

   ```bash
   cd /vagrant
   ./startsdkbuild.sh
   ```

   *By default, the current host directory is shared on the guest as `/vagrant`.*

### Setup with script (optional)

If you choose *NOT* to use Vagrant (for example a Cloud9/EC2 instance, stand alone box, or other configuration), the `bootstrap.sh` script can be used to set up the SDK to be ready to build.

1. Run the provisioning script

   ```bash
   bootstrap.sh
   ```

2. As with Vagrant, the provisioning script will 

* Download cross-compiling toolchains
* Clone the TI SDK from the git repo
* Setup the SDK for development with meta-aws
* Clone the meta-aws layer into the SDK tree

3. The build can be initiated with

   ```bash
   startsdkbuild.sh
   ```

*The configuration of the virtual machine can be configured to limit processor and/or memory utilization, forward ports, share directories, etc by modifying `Vagrantfile`*

### Manual setup and configuration


1. [Download and install the TI Processor SDK for Linux
   (Automotive)](http://www.ti.com/tool/PROCESSOR-SDK-DRA8X-TDA4X).
   **Note** we will be using the flash utilities and boot files but
   will not be using the Arago source tree from the distribution.
2. Download the appropriate compiler for [the Arm / GNU compiler
version
9-2-2019-12](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-a/downloads/9-2-2019-12).
Unpack to your $HOME directory or some other directory you will use
later.  Later in this tutorial you will see I put them into
$BASEDIR/toolchains.
3. An [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/free) and an [AWS Identity
   and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) with
   authorization to run the [IoT Greengrass
   Tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/gg-gs.html)
   in the context of your logged in [IAM
   User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_identity-management.html).

## Build and flash the image

The build and flash instructions are very similar to what is in the
Texas Instruments documentation for [Processor SDK for Linux Section
1.2.2.2](http://software-dl.ti.com/processor-sdk-linux/esd/docs/latest/linux/Overview_Building_the_SDK.html#build-steps)
with some minor modifications to include IoT Greengrass.

1. Open a terminal window on your workstation.  Clone the Arago
   distribution to your workstation.  **NOTE**

   For the sake of this tutorial, the variable `BASE` refers to the
   build environment parent directory.  For many people, this will be
   `$HOME`.  If you are using another partition as the base directory,
   please set it accordingly.

   ```bash
   export BASEDIR=$HOME
   ```

   Clone TI's Arago SDK and use the **zeus** environment.

   ```bash
   cd $BASEDIR
   git clone git://arago-project.org/git/projects/oe-layersetup.git tisdk
   ```

2. Source the Yocto environment script.  This tutorial was written
   using the latest Processor SDK Linux Automotive at the time which was at version 06\_02\_00.

   ```bash
   cd $BASEDIR/tisdk
   ./oe-layertool-setup.sh -f configs/arago-zeus-config.txt
   cd build
   . conf/setenv
   ```

3. Copy the `local.conf` we will use for this demonstration to your `conf` directory.

   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/meta-aws-demos/master/TDA4VMXEVM/aws_iot_greengrass/j7-evm_iot_greengrass.conf
   mv j7-evm_iot_greengrass.conf \
      $BASEDIR/tisdk/build/conf/j7-evm_iot_greengrass.conf
   ```

4. The TI Processor SDK includes the meta-aws project in the source
   tree automatically. In this case, we are using the Arago project so
   we must clone it out specifically.  To get the latest aligned
   version of IoT Greengrass, ensure that the repository is up to date
   and use the `zeus` branch.  At the version of the SDK used, the
   `zeus` Yocto Project is supported by the TI SDK.

   ```bash
   cd $BASEDIR/tisdk/sources
   git clone -b zeus https://github.com/aws/meta-aws
   
   ```

5. Add the `meta-aws` and `meta-java` layers to the build.

   ```text
   /src/tisdk/build/conf$ diff bblayers.conf.1 bblayers.conf 30a31,32
 	> /src/tisdk/sources/meta-aws \
   ```

6. Ensure the toolchain is configured in your terminal's environment.

   ```bash
   export TOOLCHAIN_PATH_ARMV7=$BASEDIR/toolchains/gcc-arm-9.2-2019.12-x86_64-arm-none-linux-gnueabihf
   export TOOLCHAIN_PATH_ARMV8=$BASEDIR/toolchains/gcc-arm-9.2-2019.12-x86_64-aarch64-none-linux-gnu
   ```
7. Build the image.

   ```bash
   cd $BASEDIR/tisdk/build
   . conf/setenv
   bitbake -r conf/j7-evm_iot_greengrass.conf arago-base-tisdk-image
   ```

   After building, the images will be in the following directory. List
   the directory to get the current name of the root filesystem.

   ```bash
   ls $BASEDIR/tisdk/build/arago-tmp-external-arm-toolchain/deploy/images/j7-evm
   ```

8. Use the TI flashing tools to flash the image.  In this version of
   the SDK, the flashing tool is in this directory.

   ```bash
   cd $HOME/ti-processor-sdk-linux-automotive-j7-evm-06_02_00/bin
   ```

9. Because the tool must access peripherals as `root`, we must run with the sudo command.

    ```bash
    sudo ./create-sdcard.sh
    ```

    Follow the instructions at [SD Card Using Custom Images](http://software-dl.ti.com/processor-sdk-linux/esd/docs/latest/linux/Overview/Processor_SDK_Linux_create_SD_card_script.html#sd-card-using-custom-images).

    Replace UID with your home directory's ID to complete the fully
    qualified paths.  You will input the fully qualified path for the
    boot files:

    ```bash
   /home/rpcme/ti-processor-sdk-linux-automotive-j7-evm-06_02_00/board-support/prebuilt-images/boot-j7-evm.tar.gz
    ```

    And the fully qualified path for the rootfs (your time and date will vary ):

    ```bash
    /src/tisdk/build/arago-tmp-external-arm-toolchain/deploy/images/j7-evm/arago-base-tisdk-image-j7-evm-20200529171915.rootfs.tar.xz 
    ```
11. Unmount the microSD card from your workstation.

12. Boot the system as normal (turn on with SW3, reset with SW2),
    using a 115200N81 connection speed.  There has been mixed results
    using `screen` and `minicom`.  Best results have been demonstrated
    on `picocom` on Linux and `TeraTerm` on Windows.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install picocom
    picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB1
    ```

## Go build solutions

Your image with IoT Greengrass is now up and running.  What's next?

When you go through the [IoT Greengrass
Tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/gg-gs.html),
know that Module 1 and Module 2 has already been mostly completed.
You will need to follow the [Configure AWS IoT Greengrass on AWS
IoT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/gg-config.html)
chapter to initialize your account for IoT Greengrass, create your
Greengrass Group, and then apply the `config.json` and credentials to
the target device.

## Testing with AWS IoT Device Tester (IDT)

[AWS IoT Device
Tester](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/device-tester-for-greengrass-ug.html)
requires additional additional software.  To build the image for IDT,
please use the
[j7-evm\_iot\_greengrass\_idt.conf](j7-evm_iot_greengrass_idt.conf)
file.  You will need to install package =ntp= for use of =ntpd= or
else Greengrass OTA testing will fail due to potential system time
mismatch causing the SSL handshake during =wget= invocation to fail. 

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/meta-aws-demos/master/j7-evm_idk/aws_iot_greengrass/j7-evm_iot_greengrass_idt.conf
mv j7-evm_iot_greengrass_idt.conf $BASEDIR/tisdk/build/conf/j7-evm_iot_greengrass_idt.conf
```

If you would also like to perform IDT tests for Stream Manager and
Connectors (which requires Docker), use the following configuration
file:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/meta-aws-demos/master/TDA4VMXEVM/aws_iot_greengrass/j7-evm_iot_greengrass_idt_full.conf
mv j7-evm_iot_greengrass_idt.conf $BASEDIR/tisdk/build/conf/j7-evm_iot_greengrass_idt_full.conf
```

If you are building the **full** version, then you will need to add
OpenJDK to the build. IoT Greengrass version 1.10 and later requires
the Java Development Kit for Stream Manager.  Clone the `meta-java`
repository and align with the `zeus` branch.

```bash
cd $BASEDIR/tisdk/sources/
git clone -b zeus https://git.yoctoproject.org/git/meta-java
```

Add the `meta-java` layer to the build.

```text
/src/tisdk/build/conf$ diff bblayers.conf.1 bblayers.conf
30a31,32
> 	/src/tisdk/sources/meta-aws \
> 	/src/tisdk/sources/meta-java \
```


Download and install IDT to your host system.  In this walkthrough, we are using [IDT v3.0.0 for Linux](https://d232ctwt5kahio.cloudfront.net/greengrass/devicetester_greengrass_linux_3.0.0.zip).

```bash
cd $HOME
unzip ~/Downloads/devicetester_greengrass_linux_3.0.1.zip
```

Configuration files are in directory
`/devicetester_greengrass_linux/configs`.  We have provided sample
config.json and device.json files.  The config.json is setup to use
your CLI authentication (see [Setting Configuration to Run the AWS IoT
Greengrass Qualification
Suite](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/set-config.html)
in the IoT Greengrass documentation).  The device.json file is
configured for the Device Under Test.

After building, perform the microSD imaging process defined in the
**Build and flash the image** section.

After imaging, insert the microSD to the device. Boot and login to the
system as `root`. Change the password to `@w$4L1f3` using the
`mkpasswd` command.  Identify the IP address of the machine by running
the `ifconfig` command and change device.json accordingly.

After performing the settings, ensure Greengrass is off.  If you had
previously installed certificates and config to the rootfs, then
Greengrass might be started and will interfere with IDT results.

```bash
./devicetester_linux_x86-64 run-suite --suite-id GGQ_1.0.0 --pool-id 1
```

## Cleaning up

If you are running locally and do not have intent to continue working
on the local workstation, cleanup (with the exception of installed
packages) can be done in three simple steps:

```bash
rm -rf $BASEDIR/gcc-arm-8.3-2019.03-x86_64-arm-linux-gnueabihf
rm -rf $BASEDIR/gcc-arm-8.3-2019.03-x86_64-aarch64-linux-gnu
rm -rf $BASEDIR/tisdk
```

### Vagrant cleanup (optional)

To stop the vagrant virtual machine, log out of the vagrant ssh shell if already logged in, then
   ```bash
   vagrant halt
   ```
This will stop the vagrnat virtual machine, which can be restarted at any time with `vagrant up`.

*NB* - the provisioning script (`boothstrap.sh`) is only run on the first creation of the virtual machine, subsequent calls to start the VM, will not re-provision.

To remove the Vagrant virtual machine completely
   ```bash
   vagrant destroy
   ```



# Notes

## OpenJDK compilation problem

If you need to build on =warrior=, set openjdk-8 to be installed for
the stream manager feature, and get a message that says "OS not
supported" then add the following to your local.conf:

```bash
EXTRA_OEMAKE += "DISABLE_HOTSPOT_OS_VERSION_CHECK=ok"
```
